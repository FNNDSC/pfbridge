    This route module handles logic pertaining to associating
    routes to actual logic in the controller module. For the
    most part, this module mostly has route method defintions
    and UI swagger for documentation.

    In most methods, the actual logic is simply a call out

    -----------

    Main API entry-point that controls an analysis on an image
    data set and immediately returns a status update to the

    analyze and the `analyzeFunction` the analysis to perform by
    the ChRIS system.
